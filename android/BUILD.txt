The Android install instructions are based on the SFML Android
build instructions located at:
https://github.com/SFML/SFML/wiki/Tutorial:-Building-SFML-for-Android

This project is based on the SFML Android example that comes with SFML.
If you are able to build SFML's Android example, you will be able to build
this project as well.

Use a recent Android NDK as this project uses C++14.

Copy all the files inside the /src folder to the /android/jni folder.

You need physfs for Android. You can use this one:
https://github.com/dgengin/physfs
Follow the BUILD.txt instructions in the android folder.

Movie playback is not supported on Android. The preprocessor
define USE_SFML_MOVIE_STUB is used to use a stub class that does nothing
when atempting to play a video.

The Android port, for now, reads the files from the root of the sdcard.
You need DIABDAT.zip and the contents of the gamefiles folder in a zip.
Note: make sure gamefiles.zip has main.json at the root of the archive.

adb push DIABDAT.zip /sdcard/DIABDAT.zip
adb push gamefiles.zip /sdcard/gamefiles.zip

For quick reference, here are the commands to build the project:

android update project --target "android-23" --path .
ndk-build
ant debug

adb install bin/NativeActivity-debug.apk

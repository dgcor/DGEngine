Master, I have a strange experience to relate. I know that you have a great knowledge of those monstrosities that inhabit the Labyrinth, and this is something that I cannot understand for the very life of me... I was awakened during the night by a scraping sound just outside of my Tavern. When I looked out from my bedroom, I saw the shapes of small Demon-like creatures in the inn yard. After a short time, they ran off, but not before stealing the sign to my Inn. I don't know why the demons would steal my sign but leave my family in peace... 'Tis strange, no?

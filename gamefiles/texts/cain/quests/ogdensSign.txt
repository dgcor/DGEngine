I see that this strange behavior puzzles you as well. I would surmise that since many Demons fear the Light of the Sun and believe that it holds great power, it may be that the Rising Sun depicted on the sign you speak of has led them to believe that it too holds some arcane powers. Hmm, perhaps they are not all as smart as we had feared...

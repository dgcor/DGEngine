Windows

To compile in Windows, you can use CMake or the Visual Studio 2019 project.

The easiest way to get the required dependencies is to use vcpkg.

vcpkg install physfs:x86-windows sfml:x86-windows ffmpeg:x86-windows
vcpkg install physfs:x86-windows-static sfml:x86-windows-static ffmpeg:x86-windows-static

/PhysicsFS - https://icculus.org/physfs
             version >= 2.1

/SFML - http://www.sfml-dev.org/
        SFML 2.5.0

/FFmpeg - http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/
          Get both 32 bit shared and dev packages (version 2.x or 3.x)

If you want to skip movie playback support, use the preprocessor define
USE_SFML_MOVIE_STUB which uses a stub class that does nothing instead.

Linux

To compile in Linux (Ubuntu), you need gcc or clang with C++17 support
and to have both PhysicsFS >= 2.1 and SFML >= 2.5 installed.

sudo apt install libphysfs-dev
sudo apt install libsfml-dev

Optional (for movie support) FFmpeg:

sudo apt install libavdevice-dev libavformat-dev libavfilter-dev libavcodec-dev libswscale-dev libavutil-dev

Movie support is enabled by default (CMake), unless FFmpeg isn't found.
In CMake, set DGENGINE_MOVIE_SUPPORT to FALSE to skip movie support.

CMake

A CMake project file is provided. Movie support is enabled by default.
It will generate a project to compile on the target platform.

cmake CMakeLists.txt
cmake CMakeLists.txt -DDGENGINE_MOVIE_SUPPORT:BOOL=FALSE

Both PhysicsFS and SFML must be installed.
FFmpeg is also required for movie support.

Clang variant bug

There's a bug in clang which affects libstdc++'s <variant>.
If you get errors with clang, use -stdlib=libc++ instead.

Windows

To compile in Windows, you need Visual Studio 2015, since this project
uses C++ features that are present only in VS2015.

The provided project expects the following folders in the root of the
project to build properly.

/PhysicsFS - https://icculus.org/physfs/downloads/physfs-2.0.3.tar.bz2
             Compile using MinSizeRel.

/SFML - http://www.sfml-dev.org/files/SFML-2.3.2-windows-vc14-32-bit.zip

/sfeMovie - https://github.com/Yalir/sfeMovie/tree/feature/OpenFromStream
            Use this branch of sfeMovie that has OpenFromStream.

If you want to skip movie playback support, use the preprocessor define
USE_SFML_MOVIE_STUB which uses a stub class that does nothing instead.
The provided project uses sfeMovie and will fail to compile if you don't have
sfeMovie with OpenFromStream support installed. Use this to fix that.

To prevent missing DLL errors when running from Visual Studio,
place the following in the root of the project:

avcodec-56.dll          (sfeMovie)
avdevice-56.dll         (sfeMovie)
avfilter-5.dll          (sfeMovie)
avformat-56.dll         (sfeMovie)
avutil-54.dll           (sfeMovie)
openal32.dll            (SFML)
physfs.dll              (PhysicsFS)
sfeMovie-d.dll          (sfeMovie)
sfeMovie.dll            (sfeMovie)
sfml-audio-2.dll        (SFML)
sfml-audio-d-2.dll      (SFML)
sfml-graphics-2.dll     (SFML)
sfml-graphics-d-2.dll   (SFML)
sfml-network-2.dll      (SFML)
sfml-network-d-2.dll    (SFML)
sfml-system-2.dll       (SFML)
sfml-system-d-2.dll     (SFML)
sfml-window-2.dll       (SFML)
sfml-window-d-2.dll     (SFML)
swresample-1.dll        (sfeMovie)
swscale-3.dll           (sfeMovie)

Linux

To compile in Linux (Ubuntu), you need gcc or clang with C++14 support
and to have both PhysicsFS and SFML installed.

sudo apt-get install libphysfs-dev
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev

You also need to use the preprocessor define USE_SFML_MOVIE_STUB to skip
movie support. You can try to get it to use sfeMovie for Linux on your own.
The provided CMake project does this by default.

CMake

A CMake project file is provided. It doesn't add video playback support.
It will generate a project to compile on the target platform.

cmake CMakeLists.txt

Both PhysicsFS and SFML must be installed.

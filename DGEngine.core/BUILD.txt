* Windows

To compile in Windows, you can use CMake or the Visual Studio 2019 project.

The easiest way to get the required dependencies is to use vcpkg.

vcpkg install physfs:x86-windows sfml:x86-windows ffmpeg:x86-windows
vcpkg install physfs:x86-windows-static sfml:x86-windows-static ffmpeg:x86-windows-static
vcpkg install physfs:x64-windows sfml:x64-windows ffmpeg:x64-windows
vcpkg install physfs:x64-windows-static sfml:x64-windows-static ffmpeg:x64-windows-static

There is a custom vcpkg triplet that links ffmpeg dynamically.

vcpkg install physfs:x86-windows-static sfml:x86-windows-static ffmpeg:x86-windows-static --overlay-triplets=vcpkg/triplets
vcpkg install physfs:x64-windows-static sfml:x64-windows-static ffmpeg:x64-windows-static --overlay-triplets=vcpkg/triplets

/PhysicsFS - https://icculus.org/physfs
             version >= 2.1

/SFML - https://www.sfml-dev.org/
        SFML 2.5.0

/FFmpeg - https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/
          Get both shared and dev packages (version 3.x or 4.x)

If you want to skip movie playback support, use the preprocessor define
USE_SFML_MOVIE_STUB which uses a stub class that does nothing instead.

* Linux

To compile in Linux (Ubuntu), you need gcc or clang with C++20 support
and to have both PhysicsFS >= 2.1 and SFML >= 2.5 installed.

sudo apt install libphysfs-dev
sudo apt install libsfml-dev

Optional (for movie support) FFmpeg:

sudo apt install libavdevice-dev libavformat-dev libavfilter-dev libavcodec-dev libswscale-dev libavutil-dev

Movie support is enabled by default (CMake), unless FFmpeg isn't found.
In CMake, set MOVIE_SUPPORT to FALSE to skip movie support.

* CMake

A CMake project file is provided. Movie support is enabled by default.
It will generate a project to compile on the target platform.

cmake CMakeLists.txt
cmake CMakeLists.txt -DMOVIE_SUPPORT:BOOL=FALSE

Both PhysicsFS and SFML must be installed.
FFmpeg is also required for movie support.

All the CMake properties and default values:

MOVIE_SUPPORT         (TRUE)  Enable Movie support
FALLBACK_TO_LOWERCASE (TRUE)  Enable falling back to all lowercase names if file is not found

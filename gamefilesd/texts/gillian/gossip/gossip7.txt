I grew up with Wirt's mother, Canace.
Although she was only slightly hurt
when those hideous creatures stole him,
she never recovered. I think she died of a
broken heart. Wirt has become a
mean-spirited youngster, looking only to
profit from the sweat of others. I know
that he suffered and has seen horrors
that I cannot even imagine, but some of
that darkness hangs over him still.

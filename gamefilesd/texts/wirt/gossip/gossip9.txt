Adria truly bothers me. Sure, Cain is
creepy in what he can tell you about the
past, but that witch can see into your
past. She always has some way to get
whatever she needs, too. Adria gets her
hands on more merchandise than I've seen
pass through the gates of the King's
Bazaar during High Festival.

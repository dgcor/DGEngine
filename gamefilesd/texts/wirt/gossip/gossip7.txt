Farnham - now there is a man with serious
problems, and I know all about how
serious problems can be. He trusted too
much in the integrity of one man, and
Lazarus led him into the very jaws of
death. Oh, I know what it's like down
there, so don't even start telling me
about your plans to destroy the evil
that dwells in that Labyrinth. Just
watch your legs...

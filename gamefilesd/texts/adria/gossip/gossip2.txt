The greatest power is often the shortest
lived. You may find ancient words of
power written upon scrolls of
parchment. The strength of these scrolls
lies in the ability of either apprentice or
adept to cast them with equal ability.
Their weakness is that they must first be
read aloud and can never be kept at the
ready in your mind. Know also that these
scrolls can be read but once, so use them
with care.

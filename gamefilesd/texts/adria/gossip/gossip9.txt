The hand, the heart and the mind can
perform miracles when they are in perfect
harmony. The healer Pepin sees into the
body in a way that even I cannot. His
ability to restore the sick and injured is
magnified by his understanding of the
creation of elixirs and potions. He is as
great an ally as you have in Tristram.

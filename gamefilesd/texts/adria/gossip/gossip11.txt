Earthen walls and thatched canopy do
not a home create. The innkeeper Ogden
serves more of a purpose in this town
than many understand. He provides
shelter for Gillian and her matriarch,
maintains what life Farnham has left to
him, and provides an anchor for all who
are left in the town to what Tristram
once was. His tavern, and the simple
pleasures that can still be found there,
provide a glimpse of a life that the people
here remember. It is that memory that
continues to feed their hopes for your
success.

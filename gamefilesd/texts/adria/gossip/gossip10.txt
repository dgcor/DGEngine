There is much about the future we
cannot see, but when it comes it will be
the children who wield it. The boy Wirt
has a blackness upon his soul, but he poses
no threat to the town or its people. His
secretive dealings with the urchins and
unspoken guilds of nearby towns gain him
access to many devices that cannot be
easily found in Tristram. While his
methods may be reproachful, Wirt can
provide assistance for your battle
against the encroaching Darkness.

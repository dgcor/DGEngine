Hmm, I don't know what I can really tell
you about this that will be of any help.
The water that fills our wells comes
from an underground spring. I have heard
of a tunnel that leads to a great lake -
perhaps they are one and the same.
Unfortunately, I do not know what
would cause our water supply to be
tainted.

A book that speaks of a chamber of human bones? Well, a Chamber of Bone is mentioned in certain archaic writings that I studied in the Libraries of the East. These tomes inferred that when the Lords of the Underworld desired to protect great treasures, they would create domains where those who died in attempt to steal that treasure would be forever bound to defend it. A twisted, but strangely fitting, end?

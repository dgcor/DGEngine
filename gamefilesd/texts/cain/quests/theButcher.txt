It seems that the Archbishop Lazarus
goaded many of the townsmen into
venturing into the Labyrinth to find the
King's missing son. He played upon their
fears and whipped them into a frenzied
mob. None of them were prepared for what
lay within the cold earth... Lazarus
abandoned them down there - left in the
clutches of unspeakable horrors - to die.

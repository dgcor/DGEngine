I see that this strange behavior puzzles
you as well. I would surmise that since
many demons fear the light of the sun and
believe that it holds great power, it may
be that the rising sun depicted on the sign
you speak of has led them to believe that
it too holds some arcane powers. Hmm,
perhaps they are not all as smart as we
had feared...

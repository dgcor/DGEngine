Gillian is a fine woman. Much adored for
her high spirits and her quick laugh, she
holds a special place in my heart. She
stays on at the tavern to support her
elderly grandmother who is too sick to
travel. I sometimes fear for her safety,
but I know that any man in the village
would rather die than see her harmed.

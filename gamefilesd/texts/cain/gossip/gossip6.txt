The witch, Adria, is an anomaly here in
Tristram. She arrived shortly after the
Cathedral was desecrated while most
everyone else was fleeing. She had a small
hut constructed at the edge of town,
seemingly overnight, and has access to
many strange and arcane artifacts and
tomes of knowledge that even I have
never seen before.

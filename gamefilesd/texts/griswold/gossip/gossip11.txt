The Innkeeper has little business and no
real way of turning a profit. He manages
to make ends meet by providing food and
lodging for those who occasionally drift
through the village, but they are as
likely to sneak off into the night as they
are to pay him. If it weren't for the stores
of grains and dried meats he kept in his
cellar, why, most of us would have
starved during that first year when the
entire countryside was overrun by
demons.

That lad is going to get himself into
serious trouble... or I guess I should say,
again. I've tried to interest him in working
here and learning an honest trade, but he
prefers the high profits of dealing in goods
of dubious origin. I cannot hold that
against him after what happened to him,
but I do wish he would at least be
careful.

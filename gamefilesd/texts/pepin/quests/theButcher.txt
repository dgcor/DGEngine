By the Light, I know of this vile demon.
There were many that bore the scars of
his wrath upon their bodies when the few
survivors of the charge led by Lazarus
crawled from the Cathedral. I don't
know what he used to slice open his
victims, but it could not have been of
this world. It left wounds festering with
disease and even I found them almost
impossible to treat. Beware if you plan to
battle this fiend...

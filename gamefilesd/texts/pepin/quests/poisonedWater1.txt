I'm glad I caught up to you in time! Our
wells have become brackish and stagnant
and some of the townspeople have become
ill drinking from them. Our reserves of
fresh water are quickly running dry. I
believe that there is a passage that leads
to the springs that serve our town.
Please find what has caused this
calamity, or we all will surely perish.

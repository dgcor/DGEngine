Master, I have a strange experience to
relate. I know that you have a great
knowledge of those monstrosities that
inhabit the labyrinth, and this is something
that I cannot understand for the very
life of me... I was awakened during the
night by a scraping sound just outside of
my tavern. When I looked out from my
bedroom, I saw the shapes of small
demon-like creatures in the inn yard.
After a short time, they ran off, but not
before stealing the sign to my inn. I don't
know why the demons would steal my
sign but leave my family in peace... 'tis
strange, no?

Oh, you didn't have to bring back my sign,
but I suppose that it does save me the
expense of having another one made. Well,
let me see, what could I give you as a fee
for finding it? Hmmm, what have we here...
ah, yes! This cap was left in one of the
rooms by a magician who stayed here
some time ago. Perhaps it may be of some
value to you.

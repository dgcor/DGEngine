The village needs your help, good master!
Some months ago King Leoric's son, Prince
Albrecht, was kidnapped. The King went
into a rage and scoured the village for
his missing child. With each passing day,
Leoric seemed to slip deeper into madness.
He sought to blame innocent townsfolk
for the boy's disappearance and had them
brutally executed. Less than half of us
survived his insanity...

The King's Knights and Priests tried to
placate him, but he turned against them
and sadly, they were forced to kill him.
With his dying breath the King called
down a terrible curse upon his former
followers. He vowed that they would
serve him in darkness forever...

This is where things take an even darker
twist than I thought possible! Our former
King has risen from his eternal sleep and
now commands a legion of undead minions
within the Labyrinth. His body was buried
in a tomb three levels beneath the
Cathedral. Please, good master, put his
soul at ease by destroying his now
cursed form...

This does not bode well, for it confirms
my darkest fears. While I did not allow
myself to believe the ancient legends, I
cannot deny them now. Perhaps the time
has come to reveal who I am.

My true name is Deckard Cain the Elder,
and I am the last descendant of an
ancient Brotherhood that was dedicated
to safeguarding the secrets of a timeless
evil. An evil that quite obviously has
now been released.

The Archbishop Lazarus, once King Leoric's
most trusted advisor, led a party of
simple townsfolk into the Labyrinth to
find the King's missing son, Albrecht. Quite
some time passed before they returned,
and only a few of them escaped with their
lives.

Curse me for a fool! I should have
suspected his veiled treachery then. It
must have been Lazarus himself who
kidnapped Albrecht and has since hidden him
within the Labyrinth. I do not understand
why the Archbishop turned to the
darkness, or what his interest is in the
child. unless he means to sacrifice him to
his dark masters!

That must be what he has planned! The
survivors of his 'rescue party' say that
Lazarus was last seen running into the
deepest bowels of the labyrinth. You
must hurry and save the prince from the
sacrificial blade of this demented fiend!

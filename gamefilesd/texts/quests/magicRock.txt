Stay for a moment - I have a story you might find interesting. A caravan that was bound for the the Eastern Kingdoms passed through here some time ago. It was supposedly carrying a piece of the Heavens that had fallen to Earth! The caravan was ambushed by cloaked riders just north of here along the roadway. I searched the wreckage for this Sky Rock, but it was nowhere to be found. If you should find it, I believe that I can fashion something useful from it.

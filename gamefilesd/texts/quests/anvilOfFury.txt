Greetings! It's always a pleasure to see
one of my best customers! I know that
you have been venturing deeper into the
Labyrinth, and there is a story I was told
that you may find worth the time to
listen to...

One of the men who returned from the
Labyrinth told me about a mystic anvil
that he came across during his escape. His
description reminded me of legends I had
heard in my youth about the burning
Hellforge where powerful weapons of
magic are crafted. The legend had it that
deep within the Hellforge rested the Anvil
of Fury! This Anvil contained within it the
very essence of the demonic underworld...

It is said that any weapon crafted upon
the burning Anvil is imbued with great
power. If this anvil is indeed the Anvil of
Fury, I may be able to make you a weapon
capable of defeating even the darkest
lord of Hell!

Find the Anvil for me, and I'll get to
work!

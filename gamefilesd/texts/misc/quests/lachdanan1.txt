Please, don't kill me, just hear me out. I
was once Captain of King Leoric's Knights,
upholding the laws of this land with
justice and honor. Then his dark Curse fell
upon us for the role we played in his
tragic death. As my fellow Knights
succumbed to their twisted fate, I fled
from the King's burial chamber, searching
for some way to free myself from the
Curse. I failed...

I have heard of a Golden Elixir that
could lift the Curse and allow my soul
to rest, but I have been unable to find it.
My strength now wanes, and with it the
last of my humanity as well. Please aid
me and find the Elixir. I will repay your
efforts - I swear upon my honor.

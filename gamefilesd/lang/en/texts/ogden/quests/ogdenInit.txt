Thank goodness you've returned!
Much has changed since you lived here, my
friend. All was peaceful until the dark
riders came and destroyed our village.
Many were cut down where they stood,
and those who took up arms were slain
or dragged away to become slaves - or
worse. The church at the edge of town
has been desecrated and is being used for
dark rituals. The screams that echo in
the night are inhuman, but some of our
townsfolk may yet survive. Follow the
path that lies between my tavern and the
blacksmith shop to find the church and
save who you can.

Perhaps I can tell you more if we speak
again. Good luck.

I really don't understand why Ogden
stays here in Tristram. He suffers from a
slight nervous condition, but he is an
intelligent and industrious man who
would do very well wherever he went. I
suppose it may be the fear of the many
murders that happen in the surrounding
countryside, or perhaps the wishes of his
wife that keep him and his family where
they are.

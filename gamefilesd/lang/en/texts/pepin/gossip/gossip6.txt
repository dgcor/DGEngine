While I use some limited forms of magic to
create the potions and elixirs I store here,
Adria is a true sorceress. She never seems
to sleep, and she always has access to
many mystic tomes and artifacts. I
believe her hut may be much more than the
hovel it appears to be, but I can never
seem to get inside the place.

You have saved my soul from damnation,
and for that I am in your debt. If there is
ever a way that I can repay you from
beyond the grave I will find it, but for
now - take my helm. On the journey I am
about to take I will have little use for
it. May it protect you against the dark
powers below. Go with the Light, my
friend...

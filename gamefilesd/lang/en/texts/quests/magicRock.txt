Stay for a moment - I have a story you
might find interesting. A caravan that
was bound for the eastern kingdoms
passed through here some time ago. It was
supposedly carrying a piece of the
heavens that had fallen to earth! The
caravan was ambushed by cloaked riders
just north of here along the roadway. I
searched the wreckage for this sky rock,
but it was nowhere to be found. If you
should find it, I believe that I can fashion
something useful from it.

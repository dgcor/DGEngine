I was with Farnham that night that
Lazarus led us into Labyrinth. I never
saw the Archbishop again, and I may not
have survived if Farnham was not at my
side. I fear that the attack left his soul
as crippled as, well, another did my leg. I
cannot fight this battle for him now, but
I would if I could.

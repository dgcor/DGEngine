I saw what Farnham calls the Butcher as
it swathed a path through the bodies of
my friends. He swung a cleaver as large as
an axe, hewing limbs and cutting down
brave men where they stood. I was
separated from the fray by a host of
small screeching demons and somehow
found the stairway leading out. I never
saw that hideous beast again, but his
blood-stained visage haunts me to this
day.

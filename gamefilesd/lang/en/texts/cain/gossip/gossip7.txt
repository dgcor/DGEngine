The story of Wirt is a frightening and
tragic one. He was taken from the arms of
his mother and dragged into the labyrinth
by the small, foul demons that wield
wicked spears. There were many other
children taken that day, including the
son of King Leoric. The Knights of the
palace went below, but never returned.
The Blacksmith found the boy, but only
after the foul beasts had begun to
torture him for their sadistic pleasures.

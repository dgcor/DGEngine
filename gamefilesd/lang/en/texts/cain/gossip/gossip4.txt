Ogden has owned and run the Rising Sun
Inn and Tavern for almost four years
now. He purchased it just a few short
months before everything here went to
hell. He and his wife Garda do not have the
money to leave as they invested all they
had in making a life for themselves here. He
is a good man with a deep sense of
responsibility.

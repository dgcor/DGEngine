Griswold - a man of great action and
great courage. I bet he never told you
about the time he went into the Labyrinth
to save Wirt, did he? He knows his fair
share of the dangers to be found there,
but then again - so do you. He is a skilled
craftsman, and if he claims to be able to
help you in any way, you can count on
his honesty and his skill.

Poor Farnham. He is a disquieting reminder
of the doomed assembly that entered into
the Cathedral with Lazarus on that dark
day. He escaped with his life, but his
courage and much of his sanity were left
in some dark pit. He finds comfort only at
the bottom of his tankard nowadays, but
there are occasional bits of truth buried
within his constant ramblings.

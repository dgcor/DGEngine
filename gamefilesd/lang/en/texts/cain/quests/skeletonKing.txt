 Ahh, the story of our King, is it? The
tragic fall of Leoric was a harsh blow to
this land. The people always loved the
King, and now they live in mortal fear of
him. The question that I keep asking myself
is how he could have fallen so far from
the Light, as Leoric had always been the
holiest of men. Only the vilest powers of
Hell could so utterly destroy a man
from within...

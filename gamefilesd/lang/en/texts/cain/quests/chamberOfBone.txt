A book that speaks of a chamber of human
bones? Well, a Chamber of Bone is
mentioned in certain archaic writings
that I studied in the libraries of the East.
These tomes inferred that when the Lords
of the underworld desired to protect
great treasures, they would create
domains where those who died in the
attempt to steal that treasure would
be forever bound to defend it. A twisted,
but strangely fitting, end?

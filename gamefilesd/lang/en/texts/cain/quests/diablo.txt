Your story is quite grim, my friend.
Lazarus will surely burn in Hell for his
horrific deed. The boy that you describe is
not our prince, but I believe that
Albrecht may yet be in danger. The symbol
of power that you speak of must be a
portal in the very heart of the labyrinth.

Know this, my friend - The evil that you
move against is the dark Lord of Terror.
He is known to mortal men as Diablo. It
was he who was imprisoned within the
Labyrinth many centuries ago and I fear
that he seeks to once again sow chaos in
the realm of mankind. You must venture
through the portal and destroy Diablo
before it is too late!

You claim to have spoken with
Lachdanan? He was a great hero during
his life. Lachdanan was an honorable and
just man who served his King faithfully
for years. But of course, you already
know that.

Of those who were caught within the
grasp of the King's Curse, Lachdanan
would be the least likely to submit to
the darkness without a fight, so I suppose
that your story could be true. If I were
in your place, my friend, I would find a
way to release him from his torture.

I know of only one legend that speaks of
such a warrior as you describe. His story
is found within the ancient chronicles of
the Sin War...

Stained by a thousand years of war,
blood and death, the Warlord of Blood
stands upon a mountain of his tattered
victims. His dark blade screams a black
curse to the living; a tortured
invitation to any who would stand
before this Executioner of Hell.

It is also written that although he was
once a mortal who fought beside the
Legion of Darkness during the Sin War, he
lost his humanity to his insatiable hunger
for blood.

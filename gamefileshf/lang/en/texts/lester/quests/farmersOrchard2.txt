So, you're the hero everyone's been
talking about. Perhaps you could help a
poor, simple farmer out of a terrible mess?
At the edge of my orchard, just south of
here, there's a horrible thing swelling out
of the ground! I can't get to my crops or
my bales of hay, and my poor cows will
starve. The witch gave this to me and
said that it would blast that thing out
of my field. If you could destroy it, I
would be forever grateful. I'd do it
myself, but someone has to stay here with
the cows...

My grandmother often tells me stories
about the strange forces that inhabit the
graveyard outside of the church.  And it
may well interest you to hear one of
them.  She said that if you were to leave
the proper offering in the cemetary, enter
the cathedral to pray for the dead, and
then return, the offering would be
altered in some strange way.  I don't
know if this is just the talk of an old sick
woman, but anything seems possible these
days.
